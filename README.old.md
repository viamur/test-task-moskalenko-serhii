# Test Task Frontend
  The main idea of the test is not to find out how much you know React but to see how well you can deal with new technologies 
in a relatively short time. Ideally, this should take no more than four days.

      sections (info about the company, photos, top products, partners)and an integrated payment form (could be used exampled from https://codepen.io/qmar/pen/jGrQXW).
      Link to exampled theme (example): https://www.graphberry.com/item/mint-minimal-portfolio-html-template
